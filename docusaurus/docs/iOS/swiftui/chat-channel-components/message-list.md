## What is the message list?

The message list is the place to show a list of the messages of a specific channel.

The **default message list implementation** in the SDK follows the style of **other messaging apps** such as Apple's iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, and many other. In these kinds of apps, the **current sender's messages** are displayed on the **right side**, while the **other participants' messages** are displayed on the **left side**. In addition to that, there is an **avatar** of the user sending a message shown.
